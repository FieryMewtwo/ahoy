# ahoy

You wouldn't know it, but this is the repository I spend most of my time on. Yes, I know, it's empty. *That's the point*. I use it whenever I need a space to work with Git tools, but don't need to save any configs or data to GitHub. This repository has needed a proper introduction for a long, long time. 

I finally decided today that this repo should do something. So starting today, December 7th, 2021, `ahoy` will be a journal. A journal for anyone and everyone to read. A journal where I can play and laugh and vent and growl and cry and know that I can come back later if I need it. And you know what? `ahoy` will still serve its initial purpose, too. I can't stand moving to a different repo for all of that craziness.
